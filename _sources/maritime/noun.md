# 名词解释

## Ship type

### FPSO

FPSO，（**f**loating **p**roduction **s**torage and **o**ffloading），浮式生产储油外输船。[Wiki 介绍](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_production_storage_and_offloading)。

> A floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is a floating vessel used by the offshore oil and gas industry for the production and processing of hydrocarbons, and for the storage of oil. An FPSO vessel is designed to receive hydrocarbons produced by itself or from nearby platforms or subsea template, process them, and store oil until it can be offloaded onto a tanker or, less frequently, transported through a pipeline. FPSOs are preferred in frontier offshore regions as they are easy to install, and do not require a local pipeline infrastructure to export oil. FPSOs can be a conversion of an oil tanker or can be a vessel built specially for the application. A vessel used only to store oil (without processing it) is referred to as a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel. 

FPSO 生产（process）和储存油，但是 FSO 只储存油。

## STS

STS，（**s**hip-**t**o-**s**hip cargo transfer），船对船过驳。[Wiki 介绍](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship-to-ship_cargo_transfer)。

> ship-to-ship (STS) transfer operation is the transfer of cargo between seagoing ships positioned alongside each other, either while stationary or underway. Cargoes typically transferred via STS methods include crude oil, liquefied gas (LPG or LNG), bulk cargo, and petroleum products. Most of cargo operations take place between a ship and a land-based terminal. Nevertheless, it sometimes can be useful to transfer cargo from one ship to another in the open sea and this is called a ship-to-ship operation. One vessel will act as the terminal whilst the other one will moor. The receiving ship is called the daughter vessel and the delivering vessel is called STBL (Ship to be lightered) or Mother vessel. 

STS 装货的是 daughter vessel，卸货的是 mother vessel。STS 可能包含几种方式：

1. 两船（有动力）海上操纵
2. 单船锚地操纵
3. 单船停泊码头操纵

Wiki 上的操作方式有所不同，但我有些看不懂，所以暂时写上中国船级社的《船对船过驳指南》（2019）的内容。
