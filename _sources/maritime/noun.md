### FPSO

FPSO，（**f**loating **p**roduction **s**torage and **o**ffloading），浮式生产储油外输船。[Wiki 介绍](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_production_storage_and_offloading)

> A floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is a floating vessel used by the offshore oil and gas industry for the production and processing of hydrocarbons, and for the storage of oil. An FPSO vessel is designed to receive hydrocarbons produced by itself or from nearby platforms or subsea template, process them, and store oil until it can be offloaded onto a tanker or, less frequently, transported through a pipeline. FPSOs are preferred in frontier offshore regions as they are easy to install, and do not require a local pipeline infrastructure to export oil. FPSOs can be a conversion of an oil tanker or can be a vessel built specially for the application. A vessel used only to store oil (without processing it) is referred to as a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel. 

简单来说就是 FPSO 生产（process）和储存油，但是 FSO 只储存油。
